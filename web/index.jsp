        <h3>Welcom to FWFP System!</h3>
        <P>Our Food Waste Reduction Platform (FWRP) aims to address the global issue of food waste by providing a comprehensive solution that connects food retailers, consumers, and charitable organizations. The platform enables account creation for various user types and offers tailored functionalities for each user role upon successful registration. Retailers manage their inventories, highlighting and listing surplus items near expiration for donations or discounted sales. Charitable organizations engage by claiming these items, ensuring they are utilized efficiently, while consumers can "purchase" available goods at reduced prices. To keep all parties informed, the platform offers a subscription service for surplus food alerts, providing automated notifications tailored to user preferences and location. </P>
